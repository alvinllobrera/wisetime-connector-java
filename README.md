# WiseTime Java Connector

WiseTime Java Connector is an open source library that enables you to write a WiseTime connector with a few lines of Java code. It wraps the [WiseTime Connect API](https://wisetime.io/docs/connect/api/) under the hood.

[WiseTime](https://wisetime.io) is a passive, privacy-first timekeeping system that summarises your tasks while you work. With [WiseTime Connect](https://wisetime.io/docs/connect/), you can connect your systems to WiseTime, so that you can automatically:

* Create tags and tag keywords in WiseTime when records are added to your system
* Receive posted time when users post their time sheets to WiseTime
